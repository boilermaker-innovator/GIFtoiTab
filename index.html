            <h2>The Spark</h2>
            <p>It was 2019, and CoverCard.com.au was wrapping up. Sitting there with my business co-founder Matt Tomlins, a thought struck me: "How could we have promoted CoverCard better, and for free?"</p>
            <p>This led me to the App Store, where I discovered something interesting - a GIF Maker app. As I explored it, I realized how simple it was to select photos, add text, and share to social media. The ease of it hit me hard. Why hadn't I thought of this during CoverCard's active days?</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The CoverCard Connection</h2>
            <p>CoverCard was our solution for simplifying job applications in the mining industry. Based in Perth, I saw firsthand how the Pilbara mining boom created chaos in recruitment. Workers needed multiple certifications, recruitment agents were overwhelmed with paperwork, and the process was crying out for streamlining.</p>
            <p>What we built was good - a platform where tradesman could store their qualifications, certifications, and tickets in one place. But perhaps what we were missing wasn't just a better product, but a better way to show it to the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Evolution of an Idea</h2>
            <p>Living in Adelaide from 2019 to 2024, I kept seeing the same recruitment challenges I'd witnessed with CoverCard. But now, I was thinking about a different angle - not just solving the problem, but how to share solutions effectively.</p>
            <p>The name "Gifylink" came from combining the idea of GIFs telling a story with promoting links. At first, people would laugh at the name - GIFs were seen as something funny, not serious. But I saw something deeper: the power of quick, visual information sharing.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The AI Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>Then ChatGPT arrived, and everything shifted into high gear. Suddenly, brainstorming and prototyping became faster and dynamic. I could explore different approaches, test concepts, and refine ideas rapidly. The Gifylink concept started evolving into something more comprehensive.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Form Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>Then came the moment that changed everything - a simple but powerful realization. While exploring ways to create quick summaries of content, I discovered something obvious yet revolutionary: we didn't need AI at all. All we needed was a well-designed form.</p>
            <p>This was a game-changer. Instead of complex systems, we could give people simple forms to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add their key information</li>
                <li>Upload one relevant image</li>
                <li>Create professional quick summaries</li>
                <li>Share their content effectively</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The power wasn't in the technology - it was in giving people an easy way to summarize their information. When someone sees an (i) icon, they expect a quick summary of what they need to know. This revelation simplified everything and opened up endless possibilities.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Power of (i)</h2>
            <p>This focus on quick summaries led to another crucial realization. While exploring different icons and symbols, the answer was staring right at us - the universal information symbol (i). Everyone already knows what it means, every website user understands it: click for more information.</p>
            <p>Why reinvent the wheel when the perfect solution already exists? The (i) symbol is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Universally recognized</li>
                <li>Professional and trusted</li>
                <li>Space-efficient</li>
                <li>Works across all devices</li>
                <li>Needs no explanation</li>
                <li>Already part of the web's visual language</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Starting Simple</h2>
            <p>This understanding shaped our starting point. Instead of creating a complex new system, we're beginning with what people already know and trust:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A simple (i) icon next to domain names and links</li>
                <li>Click to see a quick summary</li>
                <li>One clear image</li>
                <li>Essential information only</li>
                <li>Optional action link</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's like a digital business card for your website or product - giving visitors exactly what they need to know in seconds.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>WordPress: The Natural First Step</h2>
            <p>With millions of websites already on WordPress, it became clear where to start. A simple plugin that lets WordPress users add these quick summaries to their:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Website previews</li>
                <li>Product descriptions</li>
                <li>Service offerings</li>
